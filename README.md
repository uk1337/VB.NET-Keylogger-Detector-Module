# Keylogger Detector Module
The KeyloggerDetector module is a VB.NET module that can be used to detect and prevent keyloggers from capturing keyboard input by detecting Windows hooks.


## Getting Started
To use the KeyloggerDetector module in your VB.NET project, simply import the module and call the StartKeyloggerDetection function to start the keyboard hook. When a key is pressed, the HookCallback function is called and appropriate action can be taken to prevent keylogging. To stop the keyboard hook, call the StopKeyloggerDetection function.

```vb.net
Imports KeyloggerDetector

'Start the keyboard hook.
StartKeyloggerDetection()

'Stop the keyboard hook.
StopKeyloggerDetection()
```
In the code above, we first import the KeyloggerDetector module. We then start the keyboard hook by calling the StartKeyloggerDetection function, which sets up a low-level keyboard hook using the Windows API. This allows us to detect when keys are pressed on the keyboard. When a key is pressed, the HookCallback function is called, which can be used to perform some action to prevent keylogging. Finally, we stop the keyboard hook by calling the StopKeyloggerDetection function.


```vb.net
Private Function HookCallback(ByVal nCode As Integer, ByVal wParam As Integer, ByVal lParam As IntPtr) As Integer
    If nCode >= 0 AndAlso wParam = WM_KEYDOWN Then
        'Key was pressed, take appropriate action to prevent keylogging.
    End If

    Return CallNextHookEx(hHook, nCode, wParam, lParam)
End Function
```
In the HookCallback function, we first check that the nCode parameter is greater than or equal to zero, which indicates that the keyboard hook is working properly. We then check that the wParam parameter is equal to WM_KEYDOWN, which indicates that a key has been pressed. If these conditions are met, we can take appropriate action to prevent keylogging.


```vb.net
Private Function SetHook(ByVal proc As LowLevelKeyboardProc) As Boolean
    Using curProcess As Process = Process.GetCurrentProcess()
        Using curModule As ProcessModule = curProcess.MainModule
            hHook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL, proc, GetModuleHandle(curModule.ModuleName), 0)
        End Using
    End Using

    Return hHook <> IntPtr.Zero
End Function
```
In the SetHook function, we use the Windows API to set up a low-level keyboard hook. We use the GetCurrentProcess and GetModuleHandle functions to get the current process and module, respectively. We then call the SetWindowsHookEx function to set up the keyboard hook.
